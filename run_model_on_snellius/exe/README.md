# Create an executable file of STEMMUS_SCOPE

If you want to run the STEMMUS_SCOPE model, you need to run it using MATLAB or
[MATLAB Runtime](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). You don't need a license for MATLAB Runtime. 

The file `STEMMUS_SCOPE` under `exe` directory is an executable file of
STEMMUS_SCOPE that is created using MATLAB version `2021a` in a Linux system.
Note that the version of the MATLAB Runtime is tied to the version of MATLAB.
For more information, see [How to run STEMMUS_SCOPE on
CRIB](../README.md#how-to-run-stemmus_scope-on-crib) or [How to run
STEMMUS_SCOPE on Snellius](../README.md#how-to-run-stemmus_scope-on-snellius).

To re-create an executable file of `STEMMUS_SCOPE`, you need a license for [MATLAB compiler](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/compiler.html).
In order to use MATLAB on Snellius, you need to send a request to add you to the
user pool. The bash script `build_stemmus_scope_exe.sh` creates an executable
file on Snelluis of Surf.nl.
