Enable two-factor authentication  It is strongly recommended using two-factor authentication. Here is the link of [Configuring two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).  ### 2. Set ssh connection  With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit. Please follow the instructions below. If you like to know more, see [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)  #### 2.1. Checking for existing SSH keys  Open a terminal and run the command below:  <pre><code>ls -la ~/.ssh\n</code></pre>  This command lists the files with extension `.pub` like `id_rsa.pub` in the `.ssh` directory, if they exist. If you receive an error that `~/.ssh` doesn't exist, or you don't see any files with extension `.pub`, you do not have an existing SSH key pair. So, continue with step **2.2**. Otherwise, skip step 2.2 and continue with step **2.3**.  #### 2.2. Generating a new SSH key  Open a terminal and run the command below but replace `your_user_email` with your own GitHub email address:  <pre><code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_user_email\"\n</code></pre>  When you're prompted to \"Enter a file in which to save the key,\" press `Enter`. This accepts the default file location.  The next prompt asks \"Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase)\", type a secure passphrase. For more information, see [Working with SSH key passphrases](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases).  #### 2.3. Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent  Open a terminal and run the command below:  <pre><code>eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n</code></pre>  Then, run the command below:  <pre><code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n</code></pre>  This asks for your \"passphrase\" that was provided in the previous step.  #### 2.4. Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account  Please follow steps 1 to 8 in this [GitHub instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).  ### 3. Configure git  #### 3.1. Set name and email  Open a terminal, and run the commands below one by one but replace `your_user_name` and `your_user_email` with your own GitHub information:  <pre><code>git config --global user.name \"your_user_name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"your_user_email\"\n</code></pre>  #### 3.2. Set line endings  Change the way Git encodes line endings on Linux as:  <pre><code>git config --global core.autocrlf input\n</code></pre>  #### 3.3. Set text editor  We can set `nano` as our favorite text editor, following:  <pre><code>git config --global core.editor \"nano -w\"\n</code></pre>  &gt; We use `nano` here because it is one of the least complex text editors. Press &gt; `ctrl + O` to save the file, and then `ctrl + X` to exit `nano`.  #### 3.4. Check your settings  You can check your settings at any time:  <pre><code>git config --list\n</code></pre>  For more information, see lesson [Setting Up Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html).  ### 4. Clone the repository  Open a terminal and run the command below:  <pre><code>cd\n</code></pre> Now you are in your `HOME` directory. Run the command below:  <pre><code>git clone git@github.com:EcoExtreML/STEMMUS_SCOPE.git\n</code></pre>  Now a new GitHub folder `STEMMUS_SCOPE` is created in your `HOME` directory.  &gt; In this command, we clone the repository using `ssh` option. As we set the ssh connection in [**Step 2**](#2-set-ssh-connection), this command here does not ask for our user name and password.  ### 5. Collaborate using GitHub  To know about the most common Git commands, follow the guides [here](https://hackmd.io/B4v6KwsBRzG-akLDF8e5pg)."},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#adding-changes-to-the-model-source-code","title":"Adding changes to the model source code","text":"<p>To setup the required software and configurations, see the documentation on \"Getting started\".</p> <p>It would be ideal to introduce changes incrementally over time.
