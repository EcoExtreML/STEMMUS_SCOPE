        The concept followed to calculate groundwater recharge can be found in:
        (a) HYDRUS-MODFLOW paper https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-637-2019
        (b) and also in STEMMUS-MODFLOW preprint https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2022-221
        To calculate groundwater recharge, a water balance analysis is prepared at the moving balancing domain
        The water balance analysis is described in section 2.5 and Figure 2.b (balancing domain) of HYDRUS-MODFLOW paper

                                %%%%%%%%%% Important note %%%%%%%%%%
        The index order for the soil layers in STEMMUS is from bottom to top (NN:1), where NN is the number of STEMMUS soil layers,
        which is the opposite of MODFLOW (top to bottom). So, when converting information between STEMMUS and MODFLOW, indices need to be flipped

                                %%%%%%%%%% Variables definitions %%%%%%%%%%
        Equations of the water balance are implemented in this function (Equations 8-13 of HYDRUS-MODFLOW paper) as follows:
        recharge = recharge_init + (SY - sy) * DeltZ, where:

        gwfluxes                structure that includes the outputs (groundwater recharge and it's individual components)
        recharge                groundwater recharge, which is the upper boundary flux of the top layer of the phreatic aquifer (after the correction of the specific yield)
        recharge_init           upper boundary flux into the moving balancing domain (before the correction of the specific yield)
        SS                      specific storage of MODFLOW aquifers
        SY                      large-scale specific yield of the phreatic aquifer
        sy                      small-scale specific yield (dynamically changing water yield) caused by fluctuation of the water table
        depToGWT_strt           water table depth: depth from top of the soil up to the phreatic surface at the start of the current time step
        indxGWLay_strt          index of the soil layer that includes the phreatic surface at the start of the current time step
        depToGWT_end            water table depth: depth from top of the soil up to the phreatic surface at the end of the current time step
        indxGWLay_end           index of the soil layer that includes the phreatic surface at the end of the current time step
        Theta_L                 soil moisture at the start of the current time step (bottom to top)
        Theta_LL                soil moisture at the end of the current time step (bottom to top)
        STheta_L                soil moisture at the start of the current time step (top to bottom)
        STheta_LL               soil moisture at the end of the current time step (top to bottom)
        soilThick               cumulative soil layers thickness (from top to bottom)
        indxAqLay               index of the MODFLOW aquifer that corresponds to each STEMMUS soil layer
        aqlevels                elevation of top surface level and all bottom levels of aquifer layers, received from MODFLOW through BMI

    % Start Recharge calculations
    % (a) Define the upper and lower boundaries of the moving balancing domain
    % The moving balancing domain is located between depToGWT_strt and depToGWT_end
    [depToGWT_end, indxGWLay_end] = groundwater.findPhreaticSurface(SoilVariables.hh, KT, GroundwaterSettings.soilThick, GroundwaterSettings.indxBotmLayer_R, ModelSettings);
    % indxRchrg and indxRchrgMax are the indices of the upper and lower levels of the moving boundary
    % Following the HYDRUS-MODFLOW paper and also STEMMUS-MODFLOW, indxRchrg and indxRchrgMax are defined as in the next two lines
    indxRchrgMax = max(indxGWLay_strt, indxGWLay_end) + 2; % the positive 2 is a user-specified value to define lower boundary of the moving boundary
    % indxRchrg = min(indxGWLay_strt, indxGWLay_end) - 3; % the negative 2 or 3 is a user-specified value to define upper boundary of the moving boundary
    % However, I comment the line above and use a slightly different way (ignore the moving layer boundaries and extract recharge from the two layers above groundwater table)
    indxRchrg = min(indxGWLay_strt, indxGWLay_end) - 1;
    indxRchrg_above = min(indxGWLay_strt, indxGWLay_end) - 2;

    % (b) Call the fluxes to get the initial recharge
    % flip the fluxes (because STEMMUS calculations are from bottom to top, and MODFLOW needs the recharge from top to bottom)

    QLT_flip = flip(EnergyVariables.QL_T(1, :)); % liquid flux due to temperature gradient

    QVa_flip = flip(EnergyVariables.QVa(1, :)); % vapor water flux due to air pressure gradient
    Q_flip = flip(EnergyVariables.Qtot(1, :)); % total flux (liquid + vapor)

    % (c) Get the recharge_init (before the correction of the specific yield))
    % to avoid a zero flux value at the layer which recharge will be exported
