    %{
        added by Mostafa, modified after Lianyu
        This function finds the soil layer that includes the phreatic surface (saturated zone) and is used in the groundwater recharge calculations

                                %%%%%%%%%% Important notes %%%%%%%%%%
        The index order for the soil layers in STEMMUS is from bottom to top (NN:1), where NN is the number of STEMMUS soil layers,
        which is the opposite of MODFLOW (top to bottom). So, when converting information between STEMMUS and MODFLOW, indices need to be flipped

        Although the groundwater depth (variable -> "gw_Dep") is calculated already from the MODFLOW inputs, it is re-calculated again in this function for two reasons:
        1) In this function, the groundwater depth is re-calculated, but this time is from the STEMMUS matric potential, so to ensure that ...
            STEMMUS understood the location of the groundwater depth correctly. The re-calculated groundwater depth is stored in the "depToGWT" variable.
        2) The depToGWT needs to be assigned to a certain soil layer. Because of that assignment, there will be a slight difference between gw_Dep  ...
            and depToGWT (e.g. difference = 1-10 cm  based on the thickness of the soil layer that contains the depToGWT).
