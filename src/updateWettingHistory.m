function XWRE = updateWettingHistory(SoilVariables, VanGenuchten, ModelSettings)
    %{
    This subroutine is caled after one time step to update the wetting
    history. If the change in average moisture content of the element during the
    last time step was in the opposite direction of that during the previous
    time step, the history is updated. As an approximation, only primary
    scanning curves are used, subject to the constraint that matric head and
    moisture content be continuous in time.
