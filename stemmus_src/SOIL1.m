function SOIL1
% This subroutine is caled after one time step to update the wetting history.If the change in average moisture content
% of the element during the last time step was in the opposite direction of that during the previous time step, the history
% is updated. As an approximation, only primary scanning curves are used, subject to the constraint that matric
% head and moisture content be continuous in time.
